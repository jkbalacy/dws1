              <p>The USSR launched the first artificial satellite named Sputnik into space. As a counter act, the US government creates the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). They do so in an attempt to become the world leader in science and technology, in relation with the military. (DeGroot, "Sputnik 1957", pp. 34-39)</p>

A third computer, at ARPA, is added to form “The Experimental Network .” (Roberts, "LGR - The ARPA Network")</p>

              <p>In 1989, the World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN. Although the web was initially developed to create a more effective communication system among scientists at CERN, Berners-Lee realized that this concept could be utilized throughout the world.  The World Wide Web is now the most widely used space of the internet to date. ("CERN Accelerating science")</p>

              <p>The world saw the first release of HTML in 1990, shortly after the creation of the World Wide Web.  HTML was also founded by Tim Berners-Lee.  The language at the time was very limiting, as it only allowed for plain text. (Guns, "Tracing the Origins of the Semantic Web", pp. 2173-2181)</p>

Shortly after, Berners-Lee went on to found the World Wide Consortium, which seeks to standardize and improve upon markup languages to create more semantically written websites.

Google's success spawned the need for more semantic websites, as the consumption of information via the web grew, so was the need for companies to appear first on the search engine's result page.

              <p>A more and more devices are created with internet access, in combination with the growing digital age, designers and developers needed a more refined and efficient way of presenting content that was fluid among the varying screen sizes.  Responsive Design was the answer to this call.  With responsive design, websites can adapt according to the viewport or screen size of the device the user is accessing it through.  This eliminated the process of creating a separate mobile site, and sped up the process for creating websites. Today, responsive design is a standard.  It has become such a necessity that Google uses is as a factor for ranking their search results. ("What is Responsive Design?")</p>
